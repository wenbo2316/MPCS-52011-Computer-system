# MPCS-52011-Computer-System
This is an introduction level CS course offered in 2022 spring at UChicago, I selected this course for wondering how to build a computer system. This maybe helpful for understanding quantum computer system. This course is all about constructing knowledge of computer systems by building a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. The objective is to integrate key ideas from algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, compilers, and software engineering into one unified framework. 

Along the way, we'll explore ideas and techniques used in the design of modern hardware and software systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future trends. Throughout this journey, we'll gain lots of cross-section views of the field of computer science, from the bare-bone details of switching circuits to the high-level abstraction of object-based software design. By the end of the course, we will have written a computer game in an object-oriented programming language; compiled that program into machine language using the compiler, the virtual machine language translator, and the assembler that you wrote; and run program on (virtual) hardware that we designed.
